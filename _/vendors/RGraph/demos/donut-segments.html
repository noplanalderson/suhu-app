    <title>RGraph demo: A segmented Donut chart</title>

    <h1>A segmented Donut chart</h1>
    
    <canvas id="cvs" width="350" height="350" style="background-color: black; float: right">[No canvas support]</canvas>
    
    <p>
        This is an example of using the Pie chart that's customised to such a degree
        that it appears as more like a progress meter or a "percent complete" style meter.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The segmentation effect was formerly achieved by a non-insignificant amount of custom code.
        Now though, it's created by using the <code>RGraph.SegmentedMeter</code> custom class that's a part
        of the Pie chart library file.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This library handles all of the drawing for you and you can either use the <code>draw()</code>
        method to simply draw the meter or to get an animation you can also use the <code>roundRobin()</code>
        effect.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The chart is quite small and fits well on smaller devices so it doesn't need a lot changing
        with the <code>responsive()</code> function. The only thing that's done is the CSS
        <code>float</code> of the canvas tag is removed.
    </p>

    
    
    <script>
        segmented = new RGraph.SegmentedMeter({
            id: 'cvs',
            max: 100,
            value: 70,
            options: {
                //backgroundColor: 'black',
                //value: true,
                //valuePercentage: false,
                //valueUnitsPre: '',
                //valueDecimals: 1,
                //valueBold: null,
                //valueItalic: null,
                //valueFont: null,
                //colors: ['red','white']
                variantDonutWidth: 55,
                marginTop: 15,
                marginBottom: 15,
                marginLeft: 15,
                marginRight: 15,
                valueUnitsPost: '%',
                valueColor: '#aaa',
                valueSize: 60
            }
        }).roundRobin({frames: 60}).responsive([
            {maxWidth: null,css:{'float':'right'}},
            {maxWidth: 700,css:{'float':'none'}}
        ]);
    </script>

    This goes in the documents header:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.pie.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    
    Put this where you want the chart to show up:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;canvas id="cvs" width="350" height="350"&gt;
    [No canvas support]
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>

    This is the code that generates the chart:
    <div id="dynamic-source-code"></div>
    <script>showSource()</script>
    
</body>
</html>
